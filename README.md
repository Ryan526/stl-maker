We will use Python with the `numpy-stl` library to generate the STL file for the 3D model of the bolt. The core classes and functions will be:

1. `Bolt` class: Represents the bolt with its properties (diameter, length, thread pitch, head dimensions)
2. `create_bolt_model` function: Creates the 3D model of the bolt using the `Bolt` class properties
3. `save_to_stl` function: Saves the 3D model to an STL file

Now, let's create the code for each file.
